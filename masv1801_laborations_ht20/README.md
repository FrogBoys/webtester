# Laboration 2

## Environment & Tools
Same as laboration_1 and Ubuntu 20.04, VS code 1.48.2, and git version 2.25.1.

## Purpose
Perspective: What does the laboration aim to accomplish?
Should specify concrete goal(s) which will enable some discussion and analysis.

The laboration aims to futher solidify my foudation with in html, css, and to learn Javascript.
A specific goal would be to learn Javascript in a shallow manner to create a foundation of knowledge of Javascript.

## Procedures
Perspective: How can the results (solution) be reproduced?
What kind of problems emerged and how were these resolved?

The results can be reproduced by either having prior knowledge in Javascript like i had or to use w3schools as inspiration for the
problems.

## Discussion
Perspective: Have the purpose been fulfilled? Determine the suitability of the implementation... should
alternative approaches and procedures be considered?
Personal reflections: What did you learn? What did you find to be particularly difficult? Did the exercises
prepare you sufficiently for the challenge? What could be improved in regards to the assignment? Etc.

The purpose have somewhat been fufilled, although I would say in a simple manner. The reason behind this is to not complicate things.
I wanted to keep the solution as simple as possible to make it weasier on myself and others, as the problem is a simple one.
Thus I deemed that a simple solution was the best one for this labb.
